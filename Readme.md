Carto DB Map Readme - Web Analysis and Mapping
Overview
This Carto DB map provides a comprehensive visualization of global terrorism data, allowing users to analyze and explore various aspects of terrorist incidents worldwide. The map is powered by the Global Terrorism Databaseâ„¢ (GTD), an open-source database that includes information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2020. The database contains over 200,000 cases of terrorism, encompassing a wide range of incidents.

Dataset: Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a meticulously curated database that includes information on terrorist events from 1970 through 2020. The dataset's characteristics are as follows:

Contains information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks worldwide.
Covers a variety of incident types, including bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings.
Includes data on at least 45 variables for each case, with more recent incidents including information on over 120 variables.
Utilizes information from credible open media sources.
Provides insights into the date, location, weapons used, nature of the target, casualties, and responsible group or individual for each incident.
The GTD is made available by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) to facilitate the understanding of terrorist violence for research and analysis purposes.

Layers
Layer 1: Global Terrorism
This layer is the primary visualization of the map, showcasing global terrorism incidents across different zoom levels. The color scheme is based on the type of weapon used in each incident (weaptype1_txt). The following weapon types are color-coded:

EXPLOSIVES
FIREARMS
UNKNOWN
INCENDIARY
MELEE
CHEMICAL
OTHERS
The radius of each incident's representation corresponds to the number of reported fatalities (nkill), ranging from 0 to a maximum of 1700 fatalities.

Layer 2: Location Widgets
This layer enhances the map with location-specific widgets that provide valuable insights into terrorism incidents in various countries. The widgets include:

Sucide Bombers: Displays the count of suicide bomber-related incidents.
Successful Attempts: Presents the total count of successful terrorism attempts.
Country Breakdown: Shows statistics for selected countries:
Iraq: 24.3k incidents
Afghanistan: 16.5k incidents
Pakistan: 13.5k incidents
India: 11.7k incidents
Colombia: 8.24k incidents
Others: 111k incidents
Layer 3: Casualty Breakdown
This layer provides insights into the casualty count based on different attack types:

Killed: Breakdown of fatalities for different attack types.
Wounded: Breakdown of wounded individuals for different attack types.
Usage
This Carto DB map is designed for web analysis and mapping purposes. Users can explore and analyze global terrorism incidents, identify trends, and gain insights into various aspects of terrorism. The map's layers provide interactive and visual representations of data, enabling users to understand the distribution of incidents, the types of weapons used, and the resulting casualties.

To use the map effectively:

Navigation: Zoom in/out and pan to explore incidents at different levels of detail.
Color and Radius: Observe the color-coded incidents and the radius representing the severity of each incident's impact.
Location Widgets: Utilize the widgets to understand terrorism-related statistics for specific countries.
Casualty Breakdown: Analyze the casualty breakdown to comprehend the impact of different attack types.
Attribution
This Carto DB map is powered by CARTO and utilizes data from the Global Terrorism Database. The map is designed to provide users with an accessible and informative visualization of terrorism trends and patterns. The dataset used for this map is sourced from credible open media reports.
